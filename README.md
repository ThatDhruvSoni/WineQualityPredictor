# WineQualityPredictor
This is a machine learning model which has been created by Dhruv Soni as a passion project. I found the data for this project on kaggle and decided to make a Regression model to predict the wine quality of a number of wines based on chemical properties such as chlorides, sulphides, acidity etc.
